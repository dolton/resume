                <p>Travel makes one modest. You see what a tiny place you occupy in the world. This is the quote that always remind me to get out of the four walls of my house and start travelling. A travel could be anywhere, a place close to your house or somewhere far off in a foreign country, but unless we leave our hometown and explore other lands, we cannot learn how other cultures are, good or bad. I have been fortunate enough to travel and explore some parts of my country with my friends and family and it always fascinates me whenever a new trip is planned. Unfortunately I never had the opportunity to travel abroad, but if I get a chance, I will definately grab it with open arms.</p>

                <p>If you are in the luckiest 1% of humanity, you owe it to the rest of humanity to think about the other 99%, says warren buffet. Though I won't consider myself into the elite of the world, there are numerous others who need help in some form or the other, and even if the help is not a major one, I try to contribute for the good of the society. Yes, it surely leaves me in a precarious situation, but what is more important, to fill the bank with millions or to give it to the poor and see them smile in return. I have found my way of contributing to the society and would surely like to improve on that.</p>

                <p>One person caring about another represents life's greatest value, says jim rohn. When you do it right, social work is a feeling that is larger than your own life, and this is what inspired me to join the Society of St. Vincent de Paul. It is an international voluntary organization in the Catholic Church, founded in 1833 for the sanctification of its members by personal service of the poor. Among its varied efforts to offer material help to the poor or needy, the society also raises money for the poor. There are a great variety of outreach programs sponsored by the local conferences and councils, addressing local needs for social services. You can only help while you can after which you are at the mercy of others to help you in your needs.</p>

                <p>All work and no play makes jack a dull boy, a quote I still remember from my days early in school. Sports is life for me and I play whenver I have free time, having won various tournaments while in school and college. Also was part of the company's football team. Apart from taking part in various sports, I also watch and follow various sports, like cricket, football, tennis, badminton, formula 1, track and field events and more. Yes while working in the industry, the playing hours got reduced, but just like michael jordan says, obstacles don't have to stop you, if you run into a wall don't turn around and give up, figure out how to climb it, go through it, or work around it.</p>

                <p>Do not save what is left after spending, spend what is left after saving, a quote which caught my attention after working for three years in the industry and spending the savings on various things, things which were necessary, but with a better monetary planning early on could have made life much easier. Nevertheless, it introduced me to the world of stock market and after trying out my luck in day trying in both equity and options segment with knowledge, I have slowly moved on to investing for short durations and started studying every aspect of a market. These are still early days for me in the world of stock markets and the water is rough, but even the tallest building was not built in a single day, so I will keep trying to find better ways. Ultimately you can't keep a single source of income if you dream of becoming a self made millionare.</p>

                <p>Climb mountains not so the world can see you, but so you can see the world. Thousands of tired, nerve-shaken, over civilized people are beginning to find out that going to the mountain is going home,that wilderness is a necessity. After living all my life in a coastal town, mountains and climbing the mountains always fascinated me, where my journey began as a mountaineer. Everyone wants to live on top of the mountain, but all the happiness and growth occurs while your are climbing. I have scaled various small mountains and also the highest mountain in the state of Maharashtra, India and looking forward for scaling few more this year.</p>

                <p>Animal lovers are a special breed of humans, generous of spirit, full of empathy, perhaps a little prone to sentimentality, and with hearts as big as a cloudless sky, a quote by john grogan perfectly describing an animal lover. Right from my childhood, we had a pet dog in our house and the values of respecting a animals life were instilled inside. Growing up one thing I understood that until one has loved an animal, a part of one's soul remains unawakened. We can judge the heart of a man by his treatment of animals. Loving animals means loving all animals, not just the ones we share our homes with.</p>

                <p>The piano keys are black and white, but they sound like a million colours in your mind, quote by maria cristina mena reminds us how beautiful music can be. I started playing harmonica while a child and now moved on to play a keyboard. Apart from piano, I can also play a bit of harmonica which I plan to learn sometines soon. Life without music is dull, it is like a piano, the white keys represent happiness and the black show sadness. But as you go through life's journey, remember that the black keys also create music, what you get out of it depends on how you play it. Music is life, that's why our heart have beats and the one who plays the music keeps life running.</p>
